  Who completed your order: @Dream-123-123<br>
  Rate the order out of 5: 4.5/5<br>
  Was it completed on time: It was completed in less than a day!!!<br>
  was it done how you wanted?: @Dream-123-123 understood perfectly what I wanted, and so did the thumbnail knowing better what to do. The transparency of the thumbnail's background could be improved...was easily fixed... made perfectly and with a great design...delivered in record time!...<br></p>
